## Now i made a good READMEðŸ‘‹

<!--
**DanyloKhit/DanyloKhit** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on translator
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning modules and CTk
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on low-end projects
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with nothing for now
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about python
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: maybe on github
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: ...
- âš¡ Fun fact: 95%+ of translator app was made without AI (expect for 1 functions)
- ðŸ«  Best line of code: print("Hello World!")
